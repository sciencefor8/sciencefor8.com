<li>It is used as a fuel at Thermal Power Plants for generating electricity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 4.<br />

Answer:<br />
Peat is the most inferior and softest form of coal. Its carbon content is very low. It has a large amount of moisture and is not much suitable to be used as fuel. Its carbon content is 20 &#8211; 25%.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />

Answer:<br />
The three constituents of petroleum are:</p>
<ul>
<li>petrol</li>
<li>paraffin wax</li>

<ul>
<li>Petrol: It is used as a motor fuel and for dry cleaning.</li>
<li>Paraffin wax: It is used for making ointments, candles, vaseline, etc.</li>
<li>Diesel: It is used as a fuel for heavy motor vehicles and electric generators.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Explain about coal tar.<br />
Answer:<br />
It is produced when the gases are evolved due to heating of coal in water. It is a black-coloured, thick, viscous liquid. It has a pungent smell. It is itself a mixture of many compounds. We can get benzene, toluene, napthalene, phenol, etc., from coal tar.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
Name two products that you obtain from the destructive distillation of coal. What is the residue left in&#8217; this process? Give one main use of this residue.<br />
Answer:<br />
The two important products obtained from the destructive distillation of coal are: Coal gas and coal tar. The residue left in this process is coke. Coke is used mainly as a reducing agent in the extraction of metals.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
Where do we get coal and how is it formed?<br />
Answer:<br />
We get coal deep in the earth’s crust in coal mines. It is formed by the slow decomposition of dead trees and other vegetable matter buried deep under the earth’s crust under high pressure and temperature.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
Define the term ‘petrochemicals’.<br />
Answer:<br />
Petrochemicals are the substances obtained from petroleum and natural gas. They are used in the manufacture of detergents, fibres, polythene, etc.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
What is CNG? What are its uses?<br />
Answer:<br />
CNG is short form of Compressed Natural Gas. Natural gas is stored under high pressure as CNG. CNG is used for power generation. It is now being used as a fuel for transport vehicles because it is less polluting. It is a cleaner fuel.</p>
<h3>Coal and Petroleum Class 8 Extra Questions Long Answer Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Explain about the varieties of coal.<br />
Answer:<br />
Depending upon the amount of carbon content, coal may be of four types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peat: This is the most inferior and softest form of coal. Its carbon content is very low. It has a large amount of moisture and is not much suitable to be used as fuel.</li>
<li>Lignite: Lignite is comparatively harder than peat, but still is very soft. Its carbon content is more than that of peat.</li>
<li>Bituminous: Its carbon content is higher, as it is free from moisture and other impurities.</li>
<li>Anthracite: This is the highest grade coal. This is also known as hard coal. It has maximum amount of carbon. It produces a very little smoke.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 2.<br />
The burning of fossil fuels causes air pollution. Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
The burning of fossil fuels causes a lot of air pollution.<br />
The burning of coal produces gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, etc., which can lead to undesirable changes in climate due to increase greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>The major air pollutants produced by the burning of petrol in automobiles are carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, unbumt hydrocarbons, etc. These pollutants are harmful for human beings and living organisms which causes breathing problems and skin diseases.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Write a short note on petroleum.<br />
Answer:<br />
Petroleum is the liquid form of fuel. It is also known as crude oil and found trapped between the layers of impervious rocks under the ground. It is a natural resource, which formed by the dead plants and animals in the sea. It is a dark coloured viscous liquid and like all other oils, it is lighter than water. It is a mixture of different hydrocarbons. It undergoes fractional distillation to yield petrol, kerosene, diesel and other chemicals used in manufacture of plastics.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
How is the energy useful to us? Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
We need energy in almost every field of our life. Without energy our life is impossible. Some of the uses of energy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need energy of fuels to generate electricity and to run vehicles.</li>
<li>We need energy to run our electrical appliances like refrigerator, TV, radio, computer, etc.</li>
<li>We need energy at construction sites to construct houses, buildings, etc.</li>
<li>We need energy to cook our food and other domestic use.</li>
<li>We need energy (petrochemicals) for manufacturing fibres, plastics, paints, cosmetics, etc.</li>
<li>All the factories, industries, agricultural devices depend on power supply to run the machines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 5.<br />
List the steps to conserve the resources.<br />
Answer:<br />
As we know, we all are dependent on the resources. But we should keep in mind that resources are limited in nature. If we misuse it, our future generation will have no resources. This is an alarming situation.<br />
We can take following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>We shbuld cook our food on low flame.</li>
<li>Devices that consume less energy like CFLs and LED lights should be preferred.</li>
<li>We should take care not to waste electricity.</li>
<li>We should cover our cooking vessels while cooking.</li>
<li>Instead of use of individual vehicles, use of public transport should be encouraged.</li>
<li>Solar or tidal energy should be developed and encouraged.</li>
<li>Dams should be use to generate electricity instead of burning coal or petroleum.</li>
<li>Public awareness programmes should be conducted.</li>
</ul>

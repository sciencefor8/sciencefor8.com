The lowest temperature at which a fuel catches fire is called its ignition temperature.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
How does a matchstick catch fire?<br />
Answer:<br />
By rubbing a matchstick against a rough surface (friction), it attains its ignition temperature and thus catches fire.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Why is sodium kept immersed in kerosene?<br />
Answer:<br />
Sodium has very low ignition temperature, i.e., it catches fire on coming in contact with air, so it is kept in kerosene.</p>

<p>Question 16.<br />
Define calorific value.<br />
Answer:<br />
The amount of heat produced on burning one kilogram of fuel completely is called its calorific value.</p>
<p>Question 17.<br />
60 kg of fuel was completely burnt for an experiment. The amount of heat energy was found to be 1,80,000 kJ. Calculate the calorific value of the fuel.<br />
Answer:<br />
Amount of fuel burnt = 60 kg<br />
Amount of heat produced = 1,80,000 kJ<br />
Calorific value of the fuel = \(\frac{\text { Heat produced }}{\text { Amount of fuel }}\)<br />
= \(\frac{1,80,000}{60}\) = 3,000 kJ/kg<br />
∴ Calorific value of the fuel is 3,000 kJ/kg.</p>

<h3>Combustion and Flame Class 8 Extra Questions Long Answer Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Why isn’t hydrogen gas used as a domestic or industrial fuel, although it has a very high calorific value? State three reasons for the answer.<br />
Answer:<br />
Although hydrogen gas has a very high calorific value, it is not used as a domestic or industrial fuel due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is expensive.</li>
<li>It burns with an explosion.</li>
<li>It is extremely inflammable, so it is risky to store and transport hydrogen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Explain how water gets boiled in paper cup without burning it.<br />
Answer:<br />
When we heat the paper cup containing water, the heat given to it is rapidly transferred to water from the paper cup. The temperature of water goes on increasing until it attains its boiling point, and starts boiling. As, during this process, the heat is continuously being transferred to water; the paper cup does not attain its ignition temperature. Hence, it does not burn.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Why does a piece of paper burn with yellow flame? Give a reason.<br />
Answer:<br />
The inadequate supply of oxygen during the combustion of the piece of paper produces solid carbon particles that rise up in the flame. They become hot and glow to give off yellowish light. This makes the piece of paper burn with a yellowish flame.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
It is observed at petrol pumps and airports, that hydrocarbon fire extinguishers are used, instead of soda-acid fire extinguisher. Give reasons why.<br />
Answer:<br />
At petrol pumps and airports, there is more probability of fire break out due to oil. In such situations, soda-acid fire extinguisher does not work as it contains water or uses water to take off fire by cooling down the place. Water being heavier than oil sinks to bottom and hence, fire does not get controlled. In such a case, hydrocarbon fire extinguisher is very useful, as it contains turkey red oil, which causes the foaming of carbon dioxide gas under pressure. The foam covers the surface of the burning substances and dispels the supply of air to control fire.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Explain complete combustion.<br />
Answer:<br />
This type of combustion involves complete burning of the combustible substance. No residue is left behind. Ash or smoke is not given off during or after this type of combustion. Mostly gases, such as hy¬drocarbons go through this form of combustion. On combustion, hydrocarbon produces carbon dioxide, water and heat.</p>
<h3>Combustion and Flame Class 8 Extra Questions Higher Order Thinking Skills</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
There are three factors which supports burning. Fire extinguisher affects which factor?<br />
Answer:<br />
Fire extinguishers affect the supply of air.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Although wood has a very high calorific value, we still discourage its use as a fuel. Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
Wood pollutes air very much and using wood as a fuel would also lead to deforestation on a large scale.<br />
So we still discourage wood as a fuel.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Write in brief about the reasons of forest fires.<br />
Answer:<br />
Reasons of forest fires are:</p>
<ul>
<li>lightning if strikes forest trees or areas may lead to forest fires.</li>
<li>human-caused fires.</li>
<li>during extreme heat of summer, at some places dry grass catches fire. From this grass, very soon, it spreads to the whole forest.</li>
<li>sparks from rock falls in a mountainous region can also be the reason of forest fires.</li>
<li>volcanic eruption can also cause forest fires.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Can the process of cellular respiration be called combustion? Why?<br />
Answer:<br />
Yes. Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that breaks large molecules into smaller one with the release of heat. So, this is a slow combustion reaction.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
If you hold a piece of iron wire with a pair of tongs inside a candle flame or a Bunsen burner flame, what will you observe? Will it produce a flame?<br />
Answer:<br />
We will observe that the iron wire will become red hot and start glowing but it will not produce a flame as it is non flammable object.</p>
<h3>Combustion and Flame Class 8 Extra Questions Value-Based Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Sourav was heating oil to fry potato chips. The cooking oil all of a sudden caught fire. He took water to pour on the fire to extinguish it. But meanwhile his mother came and switched off the gas and covered the wok completely with a plate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you think pouring water to the burning oil would have worked? Why?</li>
<li>Do you think what Sourav’s mother had done is right? Why?</li>
<li>Can you suggest other ways in which we can stop fire due to burning oil?</li>
<li>What values of Sourav and Sourav’s mother are shown here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>No. As oil being lighter than water will come up and spill all around resulting in a major accident.</li>
<li>Sourav’s mother had done right because she cut off the heat and oxygen supply from the oil. The fire will ultimately extinguish if it doesn’t get the required supply of air.</li>
<li>(c)
<ul>
<li>By using excess of baking soda.</li>
<li>By using fire extinguisher.</li>
<li>By putting a completely wet towel on the pan to cut off the air supply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sourav is immature in handling such situation but his mother is mature, wise with scientific temperament.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 2.<br />
During a class discussion on ‘fuels for household’ Sarita suggested petrol. But her teacher said it is not a safe fuel for household activity and asked her to sit. Sarita wondered why petrol can’t be used as a fuel for household activity though its calorific value is high.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why petrol is not a safe fuel for household activity?</li>
<li>What fuels do we use in our houses?</li>
<li>What value of Sarita is shown here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Petrol vapourises easily so it can lead to rapid combustion. Hence it is not safe as household fuel.</li>
<li>We use LPG, kerosene and wax.</li>
<li>Sarita has knowledge of fuel but she is little bit confused.</li>
</ul>

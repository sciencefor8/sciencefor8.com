<h3>Stars and the Solar System Class 8 Extra Questions Long Answer Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
What is the solar system? Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
The sun along with the eight planets, the moons, and other heavenly bodies form the solar system. Our solar system is a part of the milky way galaxy. The sun is at the centre of the solar system around which all other planets rotate. Except Mercury and Venus, remaining six planets have their natural satellite revolving around them in a particular orbit. In our solar system, Earth is the only planet having life. This is due to the hostile conditions available in it. Sun is the ultimate source of energy for sustenance of life on the Earth.</p>

Answer:<br />
Some special environmental conditions responsible for the existence and continuation of life on the Earth are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right distance from the Sun</li>
<li>Right temperature range</li>
<li>Presence of water</li>
<li>Presence of oxygen and hostile atmosphere</li>
<li>Presence of a blanket of ozone</li>

<p>Question 4.<br />
Write few lines about every planet of the solar system.<br />
Answer:<br />
There are total eight planets in our solar system which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mercury: Mercury is the planet which is nearest to the sun. It is the smallest planet of the solar system. It has no satellite of its own.</li>
<li>Venus: Venus is the second planet in our solar system. It is the brightest planet in the night sky.<br />
It has no moon or satellite of its own.</li>
<li>Earth: It is the third planet of the solar system and is the only planet on which life exists. It has only one moon.</li>
<li>Mars: The fourth planet of our solar system is Mars. It is also called the red planet. Mars has two satellites.</li>
<li>Jupiter: It has large number of satellites and it is the largest planet of our solar system.</li>
<li>Saturn: Saturn appears yellowish in colour. It contains beautiful rings which are not visible with naked eyes.</li>
<li>Uranus: It is the seventh planet of our solar system. It is the second outermost planet of solar „ system.</li>
<li>Neptune: It is the last planet of our solar system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Explain why do we see phases of moon.<br />
Answer:<br />
The moon does not have its own light. We see the moon because the sunlight falling on it gets reflected toward us. thus, we see only that part of the moon which reflects light keeps on changing daily. This happens because the moon revolves around the earth along with this moon also revolves around the sun. Therefore, we see phases of the moon.<br />

<p>Question 6.<br />
What is constellations? Name and explain some major constellations.<br />
Answer:<br />
The groups of stars that make an imaginary shape in the night sky are called constellations (nakshatras). They are usually named after mythological characters, people, animals and object they resemble in shape. There are 88 constellations known so far.<br />
Some major constellations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ursa Major (Great Bear): It is one of the most well known constellations and the third largest one. It looks like a big dipper. It is visible in the northern hemisphere. It has groups of seven relatively bright star.</li>
<li>Ursa Minor (Little Bear): It is ladle shape similar to Ursa Major. It also consists of seven stars. At the end of the Little Bear’s tail is the pole star. It is the nearest bright star to the north celestial Pole.</li>
<li>Orion (Hunter): It has seven prominent stars. The three middle stars represent the belt of hunter and four stars form a quadrilateral.</li>
<li>Cassiopeia: It is a constellation in the northern sky that looks like a distorted letter W or M. It is visible during the winter in the early hours of night.</li>
<li>Leo: Leo contains several bright stars making it one of the most easily recognisable constellations in the night sky. It is visible in both Northern and Southern hemispheres.<br />

<h3>Stars and the Solar System Class 8 Extra Questions Higher Order Thinking Skills</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
A star is ten light years away from the Earth. Suppose it brightens up suddenly today. After how much time shall we see this change?<br />
Answer:<br />
We shall see this change after ten years only because this change which occurred today will reach to our eyes through space after ten years only.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Why meteors are not visible during daytime?<br />
Answer:<br />
The brightness of the streak of light formed by meteors are extremely less compared to that of the sun. Thus, meteors are not visible during daytime.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
If the moon emits light of its own, then would it still have phases?<br />
Answer:<br />
The moon does not have its own light. It shines due to the reflected light of the sun. Therefore, phases are formed. If the moon emits its own light then no shadows will be formed and hence as a result no phases will be formed.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Why do we always see the same side of moon?<br />
Answer:<br />
The period of rotation of the moon on its own axis is equal to the period of its revolution around the earth. So, we always see the same side of moon.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
If the distance between Earth and Sun becomes half of its present distance, what is likely to happen to life? Justify your answer.<br />
Answer:<br />
If the distance between the Earth and the Sun becomes half, then temperature of Earth will increase to alarming levels. Water on the Earth will evaporate leaving it dry. Most of the plants will die. Thus, ultimately ending all the life on the Earth.</p>

<p>Question 4.<br />
Select a convenient place on the roof of your house or in some playground from where you can watch sunrise clearly. Remember that you will have to do this activity for a few months. So, choose the place carefully. On a sheet of chart paper draw the outline of the eastern ho¬rizon indicating big trees, poles, etc. Mark the outline of the sheet so that you can place it in the same position every time. After every two weeks, note the position from where the Sun rises and mark this on your chart paper (Fig. 17.7). Also note the date of your observation. Repeat this for a few months.<br />
It is advisable that you start observations in the month of November or May.<br />

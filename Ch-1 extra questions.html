<h3>Crop Production and Management Class 8 Extra Questions Long Answer Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
What do you mean by the term crop? Explain briefly the types of crops.<br />
Answer:<br />
Crop is the term used to describe a plant that is grown in a field on a large scale. For example, cereal crops, pulses and fruit crops.<br />
The crops grown in India can be classified as kharif and rabi.<br />
Kharif crops are sown in the rainy season by June/July and are harvested by September/October. Thus they are also known as summer season crops. For example, rice, maize, etc.<br />
Rabi crops are sown in the winter season in October or November and are harvested by March/April. Thus, they are also called winter season crops. For example, mustard, wheat, potato, etc.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />

Answer:<br />
The process of loosening and turning of the soil is called tilling or ploughing. This is done by using a plough. Ploughs are made of wood or iron.<br />
Following are the advantages of ploughing or tilling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ploughing loosens the soil and makes it aerated.</li>
<li>It helps in mixing organic matter with the soil uniformly.</li>
<li>It initiates the growth of natural agents and microorganisms and thus, keeps the soil fertile.</li>
<li>It increases the water holding capacity of soil.</li>
<li>It helps in easy penetration of root into the soil.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Define the term agricultural practices and also state the important steps taken during crop production.<br />
Answer:<br />
Agricultural practices are those practices which involves the necessary steps to be taken during production of crops. There are number of steps of crop production which are to be done very carefully to ensure that crops get produced timely.<br />
Some of the most important steps taken during crop production are as under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soil preparation</li>
<li>Sowing</li>
<li>Adding manure and fertilisers</li>
<li>Irrigation</li>
<li>Weeding</li>
<li>Harvesting</li>
<li>Threshing and winnowing</li>
<li>Storage of grains</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 4.<br />
What is irrigation? Name the two main methods of irrigation and define them briefly.<br />
Answer:<br />
The artificial method of watering the plants for assisting in the growth of the plants is called irrigation. The two main methods of irrigation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional method: The traditional method of irrigation is very less expensive and they often lead to wastage of water. Traditional method of irrigation involves chain pump, dhekli, moat (the pulley system) and rahat (lever system).</li>
<li>Modern method: Modern methods of irrigation are more inclined towards the use of diesel, bioÂ¬gas, solar energy and electricity for lifting water.<br />
The two most important modern system of irrigation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkler irrigation system</li>
<li>Drip irrigation system</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 5.<br />
What do you mean by weeding? Why the process of weeding necessary? Name the methods applied for weeding.<br />
Answer:<br />
The undesirable plants that grow among the crops are called weeds. The process of removing these weeds is known as weeding. Weeds compete with the crop plants for nutrients and space. They grow much rapidly than the crop plant. So weeding is necessary.<br />
Methods applied for weeding are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual method: Manual method of removing weeds is the most time consuming method. In this system weeds are controlled by hand pulling, digging, shallow tillage, etc., by using certain implements like khurpi, hoe, etc.</li>
<li>Chemical method: In this method chemicals called, weedicides are used to remove weeds. For example, metachlor and 2, 4-D.</li>
<li>Biological control method: This method is the most commonly used method of weed control. It involves the use of some specific insects that destroy the growth of some specific weeds. For example, leafy spurge, a weed, is controlled by using flea beetles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Write short note on the terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Harvesting</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage: Storage of produce is an important task. If the crop grains are to be kept for longer time, they should be safe from moisture, insects, rats and microorganisms. Before storing, the grains are properly dried in the sun to reduce the moisture in them. This prevents the attack by insect pests, bacteria and fungi. Grains are stored by farmers in jute bags or metallic bins. However, large scale storage of grains is done in silos and granaries to protect them from pests like rats and insects.</li>
<li>Harvesting: After maturation of crop, harvesting is an important task. In harvesting, crops are pulled out or cut close to the ground. It usually takes 3 to 4 months for a cereal crop to mature. Harvesting in our country is either done manually by sickle or by machine called harvester.</li>

<h3>Crop Production and Management Class 8 Extra Questions Higher Order Thinking Skills</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Why the depth at which seeds are planted is important?<br />
Answer:<br />
If the seed is planted too deep then it will not get enough sunlight to germinate. If the seed is planted too shallow then it will not get enough soil to support germination. The depth for sowing seed also depends upon the seed size.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Why sowing seeds with seed drill is better than broadcasting?<br />
Answer:<br />
Seed drill sows the seeds uniformly at proper distances and depths, whereas broadcasting of seeds scatter them non-uniformly on the ground surface which are susceptible to be picked up by birds.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
How can nitrogen be replenished in soil naturally?<br />
Answer:<br />
Through crop rotation with a leguminous crop the nitrogen can be replenished in soil naturally. The leguminous plants, like peas, beans, soybeans, peanuts, etc., have nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their root nodules. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria, viz., Rhizobium, fixes atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) into ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) which is used by the plants.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Why is it advisable to wash fruits and vegetables before using them?<br />
Answer:<br />
Fruits and vegetables may contain many pesticides, used during the crop production practices, on them along with other germs and dust.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
What is biological control of pest? How is it beneficial?<br />
Answer:<br />
Method of controlling pests including insects, mites, weeds, etc., with the help of other living organisms are known as biological control of pest. The controlling agents are very much particular of their host pest. For example, lady bugs controls aphids, mites, scale insects, etc., which harm the crops. A wasp eats up bollworms or other caterpillars on cotton plant.<br />
Benefits of biocontrol agents are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less costly</li>
<li>Give protection to the crop throughout the crop period</li>
<li>Eco-friendly</li>
<li>Harmless to human beings and beneficial to flora and fauna</li>
</ul>

<p>Question 4.<br />
Project Work<br />
Visit a farm, nursery or a garden nearby. Gather information about<br />
(i) importance of seed selection.<br />
(ii) method of irrigation.<br />
(iii) effect of extreme cold and extreme hot weather on the plants.<br />
(iv) effect of continuous rain on the plants.<br />
(v) fertilisers/manure used.<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) Good quality seeds are essential to grow a strong and healthy crop. Also type of fruit or final proÂ¬duce desire depends on seed selection.<br />
(ii)</p>
<ul>
<li>Lift irrigation method</li>
<li>Tubewell method</li>
<li>Water wheel method Find other method yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>(iii) In extreme cold weather, water inside the plants will freeze and cells will burst from the expansion of water. Ultimately the plants will die. In extreme hot weather, the plant will loose more water than it absorb. So plant will die of wilting.<br />
(iv) If plant grows in well drained field, there is no problem, as there is no water logging. In case if continuous rain causes water logging, the root system gets damaged, as the rain blocks the pores of soil and the root of plant will not be able to take proper oxygen. So it will cause death of the plant. The continuous rain may also affect the leaves as they get torn and damaged.<br />
(v) Do it yourself.</p>

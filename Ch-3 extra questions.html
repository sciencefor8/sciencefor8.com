Answer:<br />
Plastics are those substances which are mostly synthetic in nature.<br />
Following are the properties of plastics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plastics are non-corrosive in nature, i.e., they do not react easily with air and water. They are unaffected by most of the chemicals in normal conditions.</li>
<li>Plastics are the bad conductor of heat. They do not get heated up like metals.</li>

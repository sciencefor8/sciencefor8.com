<h3>Pollution of Air and Water Class 8 Extra Questions Long Answer Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
What do you mean by acid rain? How does it affect both living and non-living things?<br />
Answer:<br />
Due to fossil fuel and industrial combustions that mostly emits nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) into the atmosphere. Water vapour present in atmosphere reacts with these gases to form nitric acid and sulphuric acid. Normal rain water is slightly acidic with a pH range of 5.3-6.0, because carbon dioxide and water present in the air react together to form carbonic acid, which is a weak acid. When the pH level of rain water falls below this range due to combining with these acids in atmosphere, it becomes acid rain.<br />
Acid rain has significant effects on the world environment and public health.</p>
<ul>
<li>Effect on aquatic environment: Acid rain lowers pH level below 5, most fish eggs cannot hatch. Lowering in pH can also kill adult fish.</li>
<li>Effect on forests: It makes trees vulnerable to disease, extreme weather, and insects by destroying their leaves, damaging the bark and arresting their growth.</li>
<li>Effect on soil: Acid rain highly impacts soil microbes and biological activity as well as soil chemical compositions. Thus affecting crop production.</li>
<li>Effect on architecture and buildings: Acid rain on buildings, especially those constructed with limestone, react with the minerals and corrode them away. This leaves the building weak and susceptible to decay. Irreplaceable damage can be caused to the old heritage buildings.</li>
<li>Effect on public health: When in atmosphere, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide gases, degrades visibility and can cause accidents, leading to injuries and deaths. Intensified levels of acid depositions in dry form in the air can cause lung and heart problems such as bronchitis and asthma.</li>
<li>Other effects: Acid rain leads to weathering of buildings, corrosion of metals, and peeling of paints on surfaces. Acid rain also corrodes metals like steel, bronze, copper and iron.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 2.<br />
What is eutrophication? How does it affect aquatic organisms?<br />
Answer:<br />
Enrichment of an ecosystem with nutrients, typically compounds containing nitrogen, phosphorous or both, is known as eutrophication. Eutrophication in lakes, ponds or rivers encourages the growth of algae and other aquatic plants. These algae grow rapidly in the water system and forms algal bloom. They compete for sunlight, oxygen and space. This badly affect the aquatic life and deteriorates water quality. This is also responsible for the large scale death of aquatic plants and animals.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Write a short note on water pollution.<br />
Answer:<br />
Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies (e.g., lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and groundwater). This form of environmental degradation occurs when pollutants are directly or indirectly discharged into water bodies without adequate treatment to remove harmful compounds.</p>
<p>Water is available both on surface and under the ground. The major pollutants of surface water are toxic and poisonous wastes from households, industries, nuclear wastes, oil spills, agricultural waste, accumulation of heavy metals, chemicals from chemical factories, microorganisms from human faeces, etc.</p>
<p>Groundwater is mainly contaminated by leaching of harmful chemicals into the soil. Seepage of sewer near groundwater aquifer contaminates with disease causing microorganisms. Accumulation of heavy metals in soil may also lead to groundwater pollution.</p>
<p>Water pollution affects the entire biosphere—plants and organisms living in these bodies of water. In almost all cases the effect is damaging not only to individual species and population, but also to the natural biological communities.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
How can you prevent water pollution?<br />
Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be careful about what you throw down your sink or toilet. Don’t throw paints, oils or other forms of litter down the drain.</li>
<li>Use enyironment-friendly household products, such as washing powder, household cleaning agents and toiletries.</li>
<li>Take great care not to overuse pesticides and fertilisers. This will prevent runoffs of the material into nearby water sources.</li>
<li>By having more plants in your garden you are preventing fertiliser, pesticides and contaminated water from running off into nearby water sources.</li>
<li>Don’t throw litter into rivers, lakes or oceans. Help to clean up any litter you see on beaches or in rivers and lakes, make sure it is safe to collect the litter and put it in a nearby dustbin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 5.<br />
How can you prevent air pollution?<br />
Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conserve energy-remember to turn off lights, computers, and electric appliances when not in use.</li>
<li>Use energy efficient light bulbs and appliances.</li>
<li>Limit driving by carpooling, using public transportation, biking and walking.</li>
<li>Combine errands for fewer trips.</li>
<li>Keep your automobile well-tuned and maintained. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on routine maintenance, such as changing the oil and filters, and checking tyre pressure and wheel alignment.</li>
<li>Choose environment-friendly appliances.</li>
<li>Petrol can be substituted with CNG.</li>
<li>Make fertilisers of biodegradable wastes instead of burning them.</li>
<li>Plant more and more trees.</li>
<li>Scrubbers need to be used in the smokestacks to reduce the amount of sulphur dioxide emission in air.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Name various techniques used for purification of water.<br />
Answer:<br />
Water which looks clean may still have disease-carrying microorganisms and dissolved impurities. So, it is essential to purify water before drinking.<br />
Municipal bodies uses various physical and chemical processes before supplying water into households.</p>
<ul>
<li>Boiling: It is a very common practice use for obtaining safe drinking water. Boiling kills the germs present in the water.</li>
<li>Filtration: This is a physical method of removing impurities and in some cases germs also. A popular household filter is a candle type filter.</li>
<li>Chlorination is a commonly used chemical method for purifying water. It is done by adding chlorine tablets or bleaching powder to the water.</li>
<li>Now-a-days filter with reverse osmosis (RO) which causes desalination of water along with activated charcoal (to filter impurities) and ultraviolet lamp (to kill microorganisms) are also used for purification of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Question 5.<br />
We should plant trees and nurture the ones already present in the neighbourhood. Why?<br />
Answer:<br />
Plants absorb carbon dioxide gas and releases oxygen. Thus, they play important role in purifying the earth’s atmosphere. By absorbing CO<sub>2</sub> they also reduces the chance of global warming. Trees provide habitat to many birds and animals. They maintain water cycle in the nature and also prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Why is it advised that industries should switch over to cleaner fuels such as CNG and LPG in the Taj Mahal Zone in Agra?<br />
Answer:<br />
With mushrooming industries and oil refineries suspended particulate matter is increasing in the air. These suspended particulate matter, dust and dirt get settle on the marble giving the Taj Mahal a yellowish appearance. This is reducing the aesthetic value of one of the seven wonders of the world.</p>

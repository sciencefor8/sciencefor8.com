<li>Metals like iron and steel are used in various tools, machinery, pipes, rods, sheets, doors, windows, construction works like bridges, roads, buildings, etc.,</li>
<li>Aluminium is used as packaging and wrapping materials. It is also used in aircrafts and automobiles, etc.</li>
<li>Metals like gold, silver and platinum are used to make jewellery and other decorating items.</li>
<li>Zinc is used in galvanisation and dry cell and chromium in electroplating.</li>
<li>Lead is used in making electrodes and batteries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 6.<br />
What are the main uses of non-metals?<br />
or<br />
How are non-metals useful to us?<br />
Answer:<br />
Like metals, non-metals also play an important role in our lives. They help us in many ways. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>We breathe oxygen which is the basis of life of all living things including human beings. Without it, no living beings can exist alive on this earth.</li>
<li>CO<sub>2</sub> which is a non-metal oxide is essential for plants to carry out photosynthesis.</li>
<li>Non-metals like nitrogen and phosphorus are used in fertilisers for better yield of plant. Phosphorus is used in manufacturing of matchsticks and fireworks.</li>
<li>Non-metal like iodine is used in the purple coloured solution applied on wounds. Sulphur is also used in preparing skin medicines and making ointment due to its fungicidal properties.</li>
<li>Non-metal like chlorine is used in water purification process. Due to its bleaching properties it is used to make bleaching powder.</li>
<li>Carbon, a non-metal, is used in most of the fuels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 7.<br />
What is reactivity series? Suggest an activity to arrange sodium, magnesium and copper in the order of their decreasing reactivity.<br />
Answer:<br />
<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-131185" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Materials-Metals-and-Non-Metals-Class-8-Extra-Questions-Science-Chapter-4-14.png" alt="Materials Metals and Non-Metals Class 8 Extra Questions Science Chapter 4 14" width="268" height="384" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Materials-Metals-and-Non-Metals-Class-8-Extra-Questions-Science-Chapter-4-14.png 268w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Materials-Metals-and-Non-Metals-Class-8-Extra-Questions-Science-Chapter-4-14-209x300.png 209w" sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" /><br />
Reactivity series is an arrangement of metals in decreasing order of their reactivity from highest to lowest. The metals occupying the higher positions in the activity series are more reactive in displacing the other metals lying below it from the solutions of their salts.</p>
<p>The activity series is a useful guide for predicting the products of metal displacement reactions. For example, placing a strip of zinc metal in a copper (II) sulphate solution will produce metallic copper and zinc sulphate, since zinc is above copper on the series.</p>
<p>A strip of copper placed into a zinc sulphate solution will not produce an appreciable reaction, because copper is below zinc on the series and can’t displace zinc ions from solution.<br />
Activity to arrange sodium, magnesium and copper in the order of their decreasing reactivity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a pinch of sodium with a forceps and place in a beaker containing water. You will notice that sodium reacts vigorously.<br />
2Na(s) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(aq) → 2NaOH(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)</li>
<li>Take a small piece of magnesium ribbon and add warm water to it. Magnesium reacts with warm water to form magnesium oxide and hydrogen gas. Magnesium reacts very slowly with cold water.<br />
Mg(s) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(aq) → Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)</li>
<li>Take small pieces of copper turnings and add warm water to it. It doesn’t react with warm water also.<br />
Cu(s) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(aq) → No reaction<br />
Hence, increasing order of reactivity is Na &gt; Mg &gt; Cu.</li>
</ul>

<p>Question 1.<br />
Why does calcium float in water?<br />
Answer:<br />
The hydrogen gas formed on adding calcium to water sticks to the surface of calcium solid and make it float in water.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Zinc sulphate forms a colourless solution in water. Will you observe any colour on adding copper turn-ing in it?<br />
Answer:<br />
No, because copper is less reactive than zinc and will not be able to displace zinc from its salt solution.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
A doctor prescribed a tablet to a patient suffering from iron deficiency. The tablet does not look like iron. Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
The tablet is not made of iron metal, instead it contains a salt of iron.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Ram stored copper sulphate solution in a container made of iron. He observed certain changes after few hours. Can you tell what changes did he observed?<br />
Answer:<br />
Blue colour solution of copper sulphate has changed to green colour of ferrous sulphate. The iron container was found to be corroded from many places. A red powdery deposit of copper sulphate was found on the iron container.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Imagine that gold is reactive like copper. Will it be still wanted? Why or why not?<br />
Answer:<br />
If gold becomes reactive like copper then its use in ornaments will decline. This is because due to its increase reactivity it will loose its shine frequently which in turn will reduce its demand.</p>

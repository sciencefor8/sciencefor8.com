<p>Question 4.<br />
Which force is responsible for downward movement of a parachutes? Will he come down with the same speed without the parachute?<br />
Answer:<br />
Force of gravity is responsible for this downward movement. No, without parachute he will come down with a higher speed.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Two thermocol balls held close to each other move away from each other. When they are released, name the force which might be responsible for this phenomenon. Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
Electrostatic force is responsible for this phenomenon. The two balls have similar charges, that’s why they move away due to repulsion between them.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
How does an applied force changes the speed of an object?<br />
Answer:<br />
If the applied force is in the direction of motion, the speed of the object increases. But if the force applied in the direction opposite to the motion, then it decreases the speed of the object.</p>

<p>Question 2.<br />
Define the different types of forces.<br />
Answer:<br />
Force can act on a body from a distance or by being in contact with it. Depending on this, forces can be classified as contact and non-contact forces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact forces: When force is applied on an object by direct or indirect physical contact the applied force is called contact force. Muscular and frictional force are example of contact force.
<ul>
<li>Muscular force: The force resulting due to the action of muscles is known as the muscular force.</li>
<li>Frictional force: The force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Non-contact forces: When a force is applied to an object by another body that is not in direct contact with it is called non-contact force. Gravitational, magnetic and electrostatic force are example of non-contact force.
<ul>
<li>Gravitational force: The attractive force of the earth which acts upon all the objects is known as the force of gravity or just gravity.</li>
<li>Electrostatic force: The force exerted by a charged body on another charged or uncharged 1 body is known as electrostatic force.</li>
<li>Magnetic force: The force exerted between a magnet and other magnet or magnetic material is known as magnetic force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Why it is easier to walk on soft sand if we have flat shoes rather than shoes with sharp heels (or pencil heels)?<br />
Answer:<br />
A flat shoe has a greater area in contact with the soft sand and exerts less pressure on the soft ground. Due to this the ‘flat’ shoes do not sink much in soft sand and it is easy to walk on it. On the other hand, a sharp heel has a small area in contact with the soft sand and exerts a greater pressure on the sand. Due to this, the sharp heels sink deep into soft sand making it difficult for the wearer to walk on it.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
What is pressure? What is the relation of pressure with area on which it is applied?<br />
Answer:<br />
Force exerted on per unit area is called pressure. Pressure is related with area on which it is applied. When the area is increased the pressure exerted is less. But when the area on which pressure is exerted is decrease the pressure increases. So we can conclude that pressure increases with decrease in area. List the characteristics of pressure exerted by a liquid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Liquid exerts pressure in all directions.</li>
<li>Pressure in liquid does not depends on shape, size and surface area of the container.</li>
<li>Pressure increases with depth.</li>
<li>All points at the same level in a liquid are at the same pressure.</li>
<li>Pressure does not depend on the surface of the immersed object.</li>
</ul>

<p>Question 1.<br />
We know that there is a huge amount of atmospheric pressure on us. But we do not experience its effect why?<br />
Answer:<br />
The pressure of air inside our body is same as that of the atmosphere. Therefore, we do not experience its effect.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Why do sea divers wear specially designed suits?<br />
Answer:<br />
Since the pressure of liquid increases with the increasing depth of sea. Specially designed suits protect scuba divers from the huge pressure of the water underneath.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Two persons are applying forces on two opposite sides of a moving cart. The cart still moves with the same speed in the same direction. What do you infer about the magnitudes and direction of the forces applied?<br />

<p>Question 4.<br />
An archer shoots an arrow in the air horizontally. However, after moving some distance, the arrow falls to the ground. Name the initial force that sets the arrow in motion. Explain why the arrow ultimately falls down.<br />
Answer:<br />
The initial force is muscular force which sets the arrow in motion. The force of gravity that acts on the arrow in the downward direction brings it to the ground.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Two rods: A and B, having same weight and equal length have different thickness. Rod A is thinner while Rod B is thicker. They are held vertically on the surface of sand. Which one of them will sink more? Why?<br />
Answer:<br />
Rod A will go deeper as it has a smaller area of contact, therefore the same force produces more pres¬sure. In case of rod B the same force produces less pressure.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
It is difficult to cut cloth using a pair of scissors with blunt blades. Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
Blunt blades have larger area compared to the sharp-edged blades. Thus, the applied force produces a lower pressure in case of blunt blades, which makes it difficult to cut the cloth.</p>

Question 1.<br />
Make a 50 cm × 50 cm bed of dry sand about 10 cm in thickness. Make sure that its top surface is levelled. Take a wooden or a plastic stool. Cut two strips of graph paper each with a width of 1 cm. Paste them vertically on any leg of the stool—one at the bottom and the other from the top. Now gently put the stool on the sand bed with its legs resting on the sand. Increase the size of sand bed if required. Now put a load, say a school bag full of books, on the seat of the stool. Mark the level of sand on the graph strip. This would give you the depth, if any, to which the legs of stool sink in sand. Next, turn the stool upside down so that now it rests on its seat on the sand bed. Note the depth to which the stool sinks now. Next, put the same load on the stool and note the depth to which it sinks in the sand. Compare the pressure exerted by the stool in the two situations.<br />
Answer:<br />
Pressure exerted by the stool is greatest in first situation.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Take a tumbler and fill it with water. Cover the mouth of the tumbler with a thick card simi¬lar to that of a postcard. Hold the tumbler with one hand while keeping the card pressed to its mouth with your other hand. Turn the tumbler upside down while keeping the card pressed to its mouth. Make sure that the tumbler is held vertical. Gently remove the hand pressing the card. What do you observe? Does the card get detached allowing the water to spill? With a little practice you will find that the card continues to hold water in the tumbler even after it is not supported by your hand. Also try this activity by using a piece of cloth to hold the tumbler in an upside down position (Fig. 11.10).<br />

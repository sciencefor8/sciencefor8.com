<p>Question 5.<br />
What do you mean by food spoilage?<br />
Answer:<br />
The process in which food is deteriorated to such extent that it does not remain fit for human consumption is known as food spoilage.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
What role does sugar play in the preservation of food?<br />
Answer:<br />
The role of sugar in food preservation is significant. By adding sugar in the food item, we reduce its moisture content and hence, it stops the growth of the microorganisms.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
How are carriers harmful to us?<br />
Answer:<br />
Carriers take with them many harmful microorganisms or pathogens. They play a great role in transferring these pathogens to a healthy person, by sitting on the food items, or directly transferring the pathogens inside the body of a person. Hence they are harmful to us.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
What is vaccination?<br />
Answer:<br />
The process of putting a vaccine inside the body of a person in order to produce immunity against some disease is called vaccination.</p>

Answer:<br />
Whenever any harmful disease-causing microorganism enters the human body, the body produces substances to fight with the entered microbe. These substances are called antibodies.</p>
<p>Question 12.<br />
What is the role of bacteria in increasing the soil fertility?<br />
Answer:<br />
Some bacteria, which are present in the root nodules of leguminous plants or free-living fix the atmospheric nitrogen in the soil which is ultimately used up by the plants. Hence they increase the fertility of the soil. For example, Rhizobium, Azotobacter, Azospirillum, etc.</p>
<p>Question 13.<br />
Define Ohmic heating.<br />
Answer:<br />
Ohmic heating is the process in which electric current of high voltage is passed through the food items to kill the microbes that cause the spoilage of food.</p>
<p>Question 14.<br />
What is sterilisation?<br />
Answer:<br />
The process of killing all the microorganisms above the temperature of 100°C is known as sterilisation. It is one of the widely used methods to preserve food, and is often used for various food items.</p>
<p>Question 15.<br />
What is pasteurisation?<br />
Answer:<br />
Pasteurisation can be defined as the partial sterilisation of foods at a temperature that destroys harmful microorganisms without major changes in the chemical property of the food.</p>
<h3>Microorganisms: Friend and Foe Class 8 Extra Questions Long Answer Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Explain why antibiotics do not work against flu or any infection caused by viruses.<br />
Answer:<br />
Viruses cannot be killed by using antibiotics as their cell pathways are different from that of bacteria. It means taking antibiotics to get rid of flu or any other viral infection is useless, because it does not re-duce the strength of the virus, nor does it reduce the duration of the infection. But, however, antibiotic will work if we get attacks of viral infection and bacterial disease at the same time. Even then, it will cure bacterial disease only but not the viral infection.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Mention any three ways through which pathogens are transmitted.<br />
Answer:<br />
Three ways because of which pathogens are transmitted are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a person sneezes or coughs, tiny droplets containing a number of disease-causing microorganisms come out of the mouth, and are released in the air. They are transmitted to a healthy person while breathing.</li>
<li>By making direct contacts with an infected person, pathogens are transferred to a healthy person.</li>
<li>Carriers of pathogens also help in their transmission. For instance, when a fly sits on animal excreta or garbage, harmful disease-causing microbes stick to its legs. And when this fly sits on the food items, pathogens get transferred to them. This contaminated food items cause serious diseases when it is eaten by a healthy person.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Explain canning.<br />
Answer:<br />
Canning is a process used for food preservation. Heat, at a certain temperature and for a limited period of time, is used to kill the harmful microorganisms as well as enzymes. This method also involves the removal of oxygen gas, and to avoid post-process contamination by airtight sealing of food items.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Explain how malaria is transmitted to humans.<br />
Answer:<br />
A protozoan called Plasmodium is responsible for malaria. It lives in the liver and blood of the person who has been infected by this disease. A female Anopheles mosquito when sucks blood from the infected person, Plasmodium along with blood, is taken into its stomach. The Plasmodium, here, multiplies itself and reaches the salivary gland of the mosquito. Now, when this mosquito bites a healthy person, it injects Plasmodium along with saliva to him. The healthy person then gets an attack of malaria.<br />
In this way, malaria is transmitted to humans.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Explain various types of bacteria.<br />
Answer:<br />
Bacteria are classified on the basis of their shapes into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rod-shaped bacteria (bacilli):<br />
These are aerobic rod-shaped, spore-producing bacteria. They are often occurring in chain-like formations, and they are found primarily in soil; e.g., Lactobacillus.</li>
<li>Spherical-shaped bacteria (cocci):<br />
They are spherical or nearly spherical bacteria; e.g., Streptococcus.</li>
<li>Curved-shaped bacteria (vibrios):<br />
They are curved-shaped bacteria; e.g., Vibrio.</li>
<li>Spiral-shaped bacteria (spirilla):<br />
They are flagellated, aerobic bacteria, having a spirally twisted rod-like form; e.g., Treponema.</li>

<p>Question 3.<br />
It is always suggested that not to eat anything from street hawkers. Why?<br />
Answer:<br />
Most of street hawkers sells food items in an open area which always get contaminated with the dust and flies carrying germs with them. Such an unhygienic condition lead to spoilage of food which when consumed can lead to serious illness.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Why oil is added while making pickle?<br />
Answer:<br />
Oil seals off the air from the item that is being pickled and thus inhibit the growth of most of the microorganisms.</p>

Curd did not set because she kept the mixture in fridge. Lower temperature of fridge retarded the growth of Lactobacillus in the mixture.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Why do idli and dosa maker add some yeast or old batter of pervious day to the newly-made batter and keep it for one day?<br />

<p>Question 3.<br />
Visit a dcotor. Find out why antibiotics should not be overused. Prepare a short report.<br />
Answer:<br />
To kill or stop the development of the disease-causing microbes, antibiotics are the medicines which are majorly used.<br />
It’s very important to keep in mind that antibiotics must be taken only on the advice of a qualified doctor. Also, one should finish the prescribed course of antibiotics given by the doctor. If one takes an an¬tibiotic when not required or overuse it, then it will help bacteria in one’s body to develop resistance to the given antibiotic. Next time when one falls sick and needs that antibiotic, it will be less effective. Excess dose of antibiotics also kills friendly microbes inside our body and thus helps to flourish patho-genic microbes.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Project: Requirements 2 test tubes, marker pen, sugar, yeast powder, 2 balloons and lime water.<br />
Take two test tubes and mark them A and B. Clamp these tubes in a stand and fill them with water leaving some space at the top. Put two spoonfuls of sugar in each of the test tubes. Add a spoonful of yeast in test tube B, Inflate the two balloons incompletely. Now tie the balloons on the mouths of each test tube. Keep them in a warm place, away from sunlight. Watch the setup every day for next 3-4 days. Record your observations and think of an explanation.<br />
Now take another test tube filled 1/4 with lime water. Remove the balloon from test tube B in such a manner that gas inside the balloon does not escape. Fit the balloon on the test tube and shake well. Observe and explain.<br />

Answer:<br />
It was observed that the balloon fitted on test tube B is completely inflated but balloon fitted on test tube A is not inflated. When the inflated balloon of test tube B is fitted on test tube filled with lime water, lime water turns milky. This is because yeast celj releases C02 during respiration which inflates the balloon and C02 present inside the balloon changes lime water milky.</p>

Answer:<br />
The electric device which is used in the tester instead of bulb is an LED. Its full form is Light Emitting Diode.<br />
It is preferred to other bulbs as it can glow even when weak or less current flows through it.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Explain the conductivity of water.<br />
or<br />
Normal water conducts electricity while the pure or distilled water does not. Explain why?<br />
Answer:<br />
Normal water that we get from sources such as taps, handpumps, wells, ponds, etc., is not pure. It may contain several salts dissolved in it naturally. This water is thus good conductor of electricity. The pure or distilled water is free of salts and is a poor conductor.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Give an example of chemical effect of the electric current.<br />
Answer:<br />
The passage of an electric current through a conducting solution causes chemical reactions as a result, bubbles of a gas are formed, or deposits of metal are seen on electrodes or changes in colour of solution , may occur. These are some of the chemical effects of electric current.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
What is electroplating? What are its uses?<br />
Answer:<br />
The process of depositing a layer of any desired metal on another material by means of electricity is called electroplating.<br />
Electroplating is a very useful process. This is used to make objects appear shiny and resistant to scratches. It prevents corrosion.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
What happens when electric current is passed through the copper sulphate solution?<br />
Answer:<br />
When electric current is passed through the copper sulphate solution, copper sulphate dissociates into copper and sulphate. The free copper gets drawn to the electrode connected to the negative terminal of the battery and gets deposited on it.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
How does a bulb glow in liquid? Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
When the liquid between the two ends of a tester allows the electric current to pass through it, then the circuit of the tester becomes complete and the current flows in the circuit of liquid makes the bulb glow. But when the liquid does not allow the electric current to pass through it, then the circuit of the tester is incomplete and the bulb does not glow.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
What is the magnetic effect of electricity? Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
When electric current is passed through a coil or wire, it behaves like a magnet. This is known as mag¬netic effect of current. It depends on amount of current passing through the coil or wire.</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
Why is magnetic compass needed to test the conduction of electric current?<br />
Answer:<br />
Sometimes, when the current passing through a conductor is so small that filament of the bulb does not get heated up and the bulb does not glow. In this case, we need magnetic compass to test the conduction of current.</p>
<p>Question 12.<br />
What happens when an electric current is passed through a cut potato for a considerable time?<br />
Answer:<br />
When an electric current is passed through a cut potato for a considerable time, greenish blue spot is formed around positive electrode. The chemical effect of the electric current is involved in this process.</p>
<p>Question 13.<br />
Why is chromium used for electroplating? Why the objects have chromium plating are not made of chromium itself?<br />
Answer:<br />
Chromium has a shiny look. It does not get corroded and it resists scratches. Chromium is however expensive and it may not be economical to make the whole object out of it. So the object is made from a cheaper metal and only a coating of chromium is done over it.</p>
<p>Question 14.<br />
Which metals, except chromium, are used for electroplating other metals?<br />
Answer:<br />
Jewellery makers electroplate silver and gold on ornaments of less expensive metals.<br />
Tin cans, used for storing food, are made by electroplating tin onto iron. Tin is less reactive than iron. Hence, food is protected from getting spoilt.<br />
Iron used in bridges and automobiles is coated with zinc to protect them from corrosion and formation of rust.</p>
<p>Question 15.<br />
Current does not flow in a circuit if there is a gap between the two wires. Does it indicate that air is a poor conductor of electricity? Does air never conduct electricity? Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
Air is a poor conductor of electricity if it is dry but in certain cases like during lightning and when air is moist, air may conduct electricity.</p>
<h3>Chemical Effects of Electric Current Class 8 Extra Questions Long Answer Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />

Answer:<br />
Thickness of electroplated items depend upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>The strength of the current passing through the circuit.</li>
<li>The concentration of the metal ion in the solution.</li>
<li>The duration of the time the article has been in the solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 2.<br />
With the help of a suitable diagram, explain electrolytic refining of copper.<br />
Answer:<br />
To purify copper, a thin plate of pure copper and a thick rod of impure copper are used as electrodes in the acidified solution of CuS04. Pure copper is used as cathode and impure copper is used as anode. When electric current is passed through the copper sulphate solution, copper sulphate dissociates into copper and sulphate. The free copper gets drawn to the electrode connected to the negative terminal of the battery and gets deposited on it. From impure copper electrode, an equal amount of copper gets dissolved in the solution. Thus, the loss of copper from solution is restored and the process continues. The impurities are left behind at anode.</p>

Normal or ordinary water is a good conductor of electricity while distilled water is a bad conductor or insulator. Ordinary water may contain small amount of mineral salts dissolved in it naturally; on the other hand, distilled water is free of salts.<br />
The following activity shows this fact:<br />
About 50 mL of distilled water is taken in a clean and dry beaker. When the tester is dipped into the distilled water, the bulb does not glow which shows that distilled water is a bad conductor of electricity. But when a small amount of common salt is dissolved in distilled water and again tested the bulb glows which shows that distilled water when mixed with salts conduct electricity.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
What is electroplating? On which effect of the electric current is it based? Why is it done?<br />
Answer:<br />
The process of depositing or coating a layer of any desired metal on the surface of other material by means of electricity is called electroplating. It is one of the most common applications of chemical effects of electric current.</p>
<p>Electroplating is a very useful process. It is widely used in industry for coating metal objects with a thin layer of a different metal. The layer of metal deposited has some desired property, which the metal of the object lacks. For example, chromium plating is done on many objects to make them shiny and attractive.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />

Repeat Activity 14.7 with a zinc plate in place of the copper plate connected to the negative terminal of the battery. Now replace zinc plate with some other metallic object and again repeat the activity. Which metal gets deposited over which other metal? Discuss your findings with your friends.<br />
Answer:<br />
When zinc plate is taken as negative electrodes copper ions are deposited on zinc plate.<br />
Similarly, the copper ions will be deposited on the plate taken as negative electrode. The process is known as electroplating.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Find out if there is a commercial electroplating unit in your town. What objects are electroplated there and for what purpose? (The process of electroplating in a commercial unit is much more complex than what we did in Activity 14.7). Find out how they dispose off the chemicals they discard.<br />
Answer:<br />
You can find a commercial electroplating unit in your town. Visit the unit and see what objects are electroplated there. Electroplating is a very common and effective method to check corrosjpn, rusting. The surface of iron metal is coated with aluminium, chromium, nickel, etc. Electroplated items are quite resistant to the attack of external agents like acids, water and corrosion. If the surface of metal is electroplated by zinc, it is called galvanisation. Chemicals or electroplating wastes are hazardous to human health and environment. They are managed according to the Hazardous Wastes Rule and treated accordingly before disposal in the environment.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Imagine that you are an ‘entrepreneur’ and have been provided a loan by a bank to set up a small electroplating unit. What object would you like to electroplate and for what purpose? (Look up the meaning of‘entrepreneur’in a dictionary).<br />

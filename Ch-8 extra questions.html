<p>Question 2.<br />
What are the main functional regions of a cell? Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
Main functional regions of a cell are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plasma membrane: This is the membrane which makes the outer boundary of the cells. It is very thin, delicate and selectively permeable.</li>
<li>Cytoplasm: Cytoplasm is viscous, transparent jelly-like substance of the cell. It contains cell organelles.</li>
<li>Nucleus: Nucleus controls the working of the cell. It is a dense oval body lying in the protoplasm of the cell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Define cell membrane and state its functions.<br />
Answer:<br />
Cell membrane or plasma membrane is a thin, delicate membrane surrounding the cytoplasm. Following are the functions of cell membrane:</p>
<ul>
<li>It separates the cells from one another and also separates the cells from the surrounding medium.</li>
<li>It gives a definite shape to the cell.</li>
<li>Being porous, it allows the movement of substances from both inside and outside the cells.</li>
<li>Its porous structure helps in regulating the movement of materials through the cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Define nucleus and state its major parts.<br />
Answer:<br />
Nucleus is a dense round body found in the centre of an animal cell and mostly on the periphery of the plant cell. The nucleus controls all the activities in the cell like digesting movement of substances with¬in tj^ie cell. Nucleus also controls the process of cell division. This is the reason nucleus is also known as the ‘brain of the cell’.<br />
Nucleus consists of four major parts. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nuclear membrane</li>
<li>Nucleoplasm</li>
<li>Nucleolus</li>
<li>Chromatin</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cell Structure and Functions Class 8 Extra Questions Higher Order Thinking Skills</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Which organism is more efficient in its functioning—unicellular or multicellular? Why?<br />
Answer:<br />
Multicellular organisms are more efficient in its functioning because labour is divided among the cells and have great capacity to survive than unicellular organisms.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
What would happen if animals have cell wall?<br />
Answer:<br />
All parts of the animal would become rigid which will make their movement of limbs and body parts difficult.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Cells consist of many organelles, yet we do not call any of these organelles as structural and functional unit of living organisms. Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
Organelles cannot function outside the cell as an independent unit. They can perform their functions only when they are within the living cells.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Why plant cells need cell walls?<br />
Answer:<br />
As plants cannot move, they need protection against variations in temperature, high wind speed, atmo¬spheric moisture, etc.</p>

<p>Question 2.<br />
Shyam being very inquisitive, didn’t listen to the teacher’s instruction properly. He took the thin layer of onion peel with a drop of water on the glass slide. He placed the coverslip on it and start observing the slide under a microscope. But he was unable to see the cells of onion peel properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think he might have forgotten?</li>
<li>What is the function of a dye?</li>
<li>What values do you get from the above incidence?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>He might have forgotten using dye.</li>
<li>Dye stains the cell and its component and make them visible.</li>
<li>We must always follow teacher’s instruction. In laboratory we must not hurry and keep patience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Activities and Projects</strong><br />
Question 1.<br />
Visit a laboratory for senior secondary students in your school or in a neighbouring school. Learn about the functioning of a microscope in the laboratory. Also observe how a slide is observed under the microscope.<br />
Answer:<br />
Do it yourself.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Talk to the senior biology teacher in your school or a neighbouring school. Find out if there are diseases which are passed on from parents to the offspring. Find out how these are carried and also if these diseases can be treated. For this you can also visit a doctor.<br />
Answer:<br />
Diseases which are passed from parents to offspring are colour blindness, haemophilia, thalassemia, etc. Most of these diseases cannot be treated. (For more information search internet).</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Visit an agriculture extension centre in your area. Find out about genetically modified (GM) crops. Prepare a short speech for your class on this topic.<br />
Answer:<br />
Genetically Modified (GM) crops have a great role to play in Indian agriculture, when we need more from lesser resources. The transgenics have the potentiality to resist biotic and abiotic stresses and result in increased productivity in addition to better nutritional quality. The hue and cry on the impact of GM crops on biodiversity has created hypes regarding economic, social and ethical concerns. Though several workers have contradicted the fears expressed regarding the risks and hazards of GM crops, concerns on the safety of a GM foods are still creating controversies. India must avoid taking extreme decisions and has to develop a symbiotic relationship between the public and private sectors, to use new technological inputs to complement the traditional methods for making an ‘Evergreen Revolution’.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Find out about Bt cotton from an agriculture expert (or from envfor.nic.in/divisions/csnrv/ btcotton/bgnote.pdf). Prepare a short note on its advantages/disadvantages.<br />
Answer:<br />
Bt cotton is a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) cotton variety, which produces an insecticide to bollworm. It is produced by Monsanto. Strains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce over 200 different Bt toxins, each harmful to different insects. Most notably, Bt toxins are insecticidal to the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, cotton bollworms and ghtu flies but are harmless to other forms of life. The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton as a transgene, causing it to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the genetically modified cotton they eat.<br />
<strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill these pests.</li>
<li>It spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology.</li>
<li>It kills only targeted pest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests such as plant bugs, stink bugs, and aphids.</li>
<li>GM seeds are expensive.</li>
<li>GM crops cannot be use as fodder for cattles.</li>
<li>Effectiveness up to 120 days, after that the toxin producing efficiency of the Bt gene drastically reduces.</li>
</ul>
